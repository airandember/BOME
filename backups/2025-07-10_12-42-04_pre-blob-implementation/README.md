# System Backup - Pre-Blob Implementation
Created: 2025-07-10 12:42:34

## Backup Contents:
- VideoPlayer_original.svelte: Original VideoPlayer component
- bunny_original.go: Original Bunny service with /play/ URLs
- package_original.json: Original frontend package.json
- go_mod_original.txt: Original backend go.mod

## Current State:
- Videos working with iframe /play/ URLs
- HLS streaming disabled due to 403 errors
- System stable but limited CSS control

## Restoration Command:
To restore original state:
`powershell
Copy-Item "VideoPlayer_original.svelte" "../frontend/src/lib/components/VideoPlayer.svelte" -Force
Copy-Item "bunny_original.go" "../backend/internal/services/bunny.go" -Force
`

## Next Steps:
Attempting blob URL implementation for better control and performance.
